</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Will you listen to my story?" tags="" position="743,314" size="100,100">I have many stories to tell you.  
If you could give me a little something to eat or drink I will tell you a story...

Born a slave - a mere thrall to work the land and serve my masters.

And yet... I am from a noble high born race.  A race that once ruled the whale roads in Geatland, but we are no more...

My story starts in Geatland when I was a young man...

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="next" tags="" position="633,613" size="100,100">I worked the cattle in the Spring and Summer.
I felled trees in the Autumn.
I built boats for my Master in the Winter.
I was often sent to row boats for the Geats as vassalage by my Master to King Hgyleac, then X and then Y.
I helped birth the cattle in Spring and shared their bed year round.

I did not know any other life.  I was born into this.

Would you like to know more about [[my family]] ? 

No. [[The day it changed]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="credits" tags="" position="873,764" size="100,100">Credits

We were a noble race that bent the Franks, Swedes, and Friesens to our desires.  We were offered gold from mines to the West, gemstones from the South, precious pearls from the East and hardened iron from the North.  

Our race withered as new tribes with new Gods and new ways came to our land. Our treasures lost to time.

We had accepted our fate.

[[The day it changed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="The day it changed" tags="" position="646,765" size="100,100">I was sent to the forest with my brother.

We went to fell trees and chop logs in the forest.

My Master had freemen work with us. Most were good. But one was not.

He liked to show off by throwing his axe at the trees close to where we worked. 

His axe almost hit me when I picked up the logs.

[[I told him to stop]].

&lt;&lt;elseif $toldhimtostop is 2&gt;&gt;He threw his ax at my feet.  

I flinched and nearly dropped the logs I was holding.

He laughed even harder.

&lt;&lt;elseif $toldhimtostop is 3&gt;&gt;He came for his ax. 

As he bent down, I kicked him.

He took his ax and swung it at me.

I dropped the logs in terror.

He missed me with his swing but nearly hit my brother instead. 

&lt;&lt;elseif $toldhimtostop is 4&gt;&gt;
I picked up one of the logs and hit him hard in the face.

Once, twice, three times.
