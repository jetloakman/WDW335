We were a noble race that bent the Franks, Swedes, and Friesens to our desires.  We were offered gold from mines to the West, gemstones from the South, precious pearls from the East and hardened iron from the North.  

Our race withered as new tribes with new Gods and new ways came to our land. Our treasures lost to time.

We had accepted our fate.

We went to fell trees and chop logs in the forest.

My Master had freemen work with us. Most were good. But one was not.

He liked to show off by throwing his axe at the trees close to where we worked. 

His axe almost hit me when I picked up the logs.

[[I told him to stop]]

I must have fallen into a large cave.

I see pillars that supported the roof of the cave.

I see objects piled together in the centre and some of them scattered all around.

I see a large mound on top of the pile.

The mound moved.  It moved &quot;in&quot; &quot;out&quot;. alt in and out.

I still hear breathing but it is not mine.

It was sleeping on a pile of gold.

A pile of freedom.

I slid down further and reached the edge of the pile.

I felt around and found a handle.

In Out In Out.

I pulled.  

In. 

Out.

I froze.

In. out. In Out.

I lifted my hand and saw I had a goblet.  
Studded with stones.  
I felt the decoration with my other hand.

In.
Out.

What was I to do now?

I was still damp from the water.

Description -It was gold. It had red gems.  It had figures of two harts.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Option A+
Where could I go now? I was not a freeman, I was marked as a thrall. No one would take me.  I&#39;d just be taken to the ships and sent to be sold far away. (poss add of more info on slave trade) 
&lt;&lt;if $goblet is false&gt;&gt;
Should I [[go in 2]]? or try to return and [[beg forgiveness]]?
&lt;&lt;else&gt;
Could this cup pay for my freedom?  If I went to the coast, perhaps I could sell it and get my own boat and work the whale-road?

Or could I use the cup to pay the wergild on my indiscretion? 
Return and [[beg forgiveness]] or [[try my luck]] at the coast?

There is a large gap in the far end of the hall.

I scramble down and with a sack collect as much as possible.

I pass the sack up through the crevice.

I fill it with plates and bracelets, torcs and small boxes, cups and swords.

I pass the sack back up.  There are no more sacks.
